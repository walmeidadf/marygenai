# Decision Log

## 2026-05-10: Use English Throughout The Project

All code, variables, filenames, comments, schemas, documentation, and CLI output should be written in English.

## 2026-05-10: Use Python 3.13+ And `uv`

The project uses Python 3.13+ and `uv` for virtual environment and dependency management.

## 2026-05-10: Start As A POC Lab

The project will start with source-specific POCs before committing to a production crawler, final database, or review interface.

## 2026-05-10: Keep Legacy Files Local

Legacy exports are useful for analysis but should not be committed. They are stored in `temp/legacy/`, and `temp/` is ignored by Git.

## 2026-05-10: Defer Database Choice

PostgreSQL, NoSQL, graph databases, and file-based approaches remain open options. The decision should follow source POC results and ontology modeling needs.

## 2026-05-10: Defer Review Interface Choice

Human review is required, but Label Studio is not yet a fixed decision. Any review workflow must preserve field-level review provenance.
